# calculator
This calculator was created for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator">Foundations Course</a> within the Odin Project.

## Functionality
The calculator follows one operator at a time, and therefore does not adhere to PEMDAS. The calculator will display a maximum length of 13 digits. For larger numbers, scientific notation is displayed, and for smaller numbers, decimals are rounded to the nearest digit for display. There is a delete button to remove one digit and a clear button to clear all history from the calculator. Decimals are accepted.

## Wish list for future updates

- Add keyboard support
